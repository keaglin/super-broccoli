[CSS: Flexbox](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/css-flexbox)
------
`display: flex` makes the *target* a flex container and the *children* of that item will be considered flex items  
flexbox properties should then be applied to the *target* element that has been converted to a flex container and the flex items therein are affected by the properties applied to the parent element (flex container)   
flex items are controlled by properties set on their flex container/parent element  
only direct children of flex containers are flex items and every direct child of a flex container is a flex item  
flex containers have a main axis (x-axis) and cross axis (y-axis)
`flex-direction` determines how flex items are rendered based on their respective axes; default is row (left -> right, arranged horizontally)
Other directions
  - column: top ->
  - row-reverse
  - column-reverse
All other flex properties are based on the main axis
start with flex then add widths and heights after you confirm flex is working  

Terms: 
  - flex-basis: flex equivalent to width
  - flex-wrap: 
  - flex-grow
  - align-content
  - justify-content
  
Flexbox is for templating, start with structure then flexbox and then content

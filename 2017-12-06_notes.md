[**Algorithmic Complexity & Big O Notation**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/algorithmic-complexity)
------
What makes a good algo? 
  - speed and memory use

Big-O notation standardizes how we discuss and estimate algo efficiency  
Big-O analysis aka "asymptotic analysis"  

O(1) complexity (constant complexity) -- complexity remains the same no matter what and runtime for these algos is static  
O(N) complexity (linear complexity) where N is the input -- processing time increases linearly  

O(N^2) (quadratic complexity)
  - for an input of size n, quadratically complex algos execute n squared times
  - if you're at this complexity, there's probably a better/more efficient way to solve this algo  
  
 `for` loops will generally be O(N) if not nested  
`for` in a `for` makes for n squared complexity  
recursion can be replaced with `while` loops in every case but sometimes recursion make a more elegant solution

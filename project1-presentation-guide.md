What would you do differently? I'm not sure. I saw a lot of people using objects for like trivia and flashcards. Maybe I'd attempt something like that

What are you most proud of?
That I started it. That I finished it. The game works. The thing is I'm familiar with DOM manipulation as a concept but I never did it by myself without like a tutorial going next to me and I'm following along. I actually chose this project for that reason. I was trying to decide between Simon and Hanoi when and something Ali said clicked. She said that Simon is probably the hardest logic wise and Hanoi is probably the hardest with regard to DOM manipulation. And I picked Hanoi because my programming logic is pretty solid. I don't know a lot about best practices but I know how to make the program do what I want and when it doesn't, 99% of the time, I can trace it and figure out what's going on. So I picked Hanoi because it would be the hardest for me, personally, and by the time I finished it, I'd have leveled up a little bit.

What would you do next?
Take a nap

How did you plan your project?
Pseudocode, high level to do list

What did you learn?
So a lot of times, no matter what I'm working on, seeing my vision through takes priority even when it's impractical. It's just a compulsory thing I do. But this project has definitely helped me put the brakes on that. Like I can stop. Life will go on. I can do other stuff even if what I've done so far isn't perfect.

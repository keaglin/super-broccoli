[**Domain Modeling & ERDs**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/domain-modeling-mongo/blob/master/domain-modeling.md)
------
Domain modeling helps us determine which data we need to have persistance
ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram, help plan/create db structure
_should_ have data types with attributes in ERD  

[**Database**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/domain-modeling-mongo/blob/master/databases.md)
------
query - retrieving info from db  
Advantages  
- data permanence  
- speed (they're built in a way to perform efficiently and can be 100,000x faster than reading from a file)  
- consistency  
- scalability  
- querying: search, sort, filter, combine related data  
[ACID-compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)  

Relational vs Non-relational db  
Relational  
  - data stored in tables, similar to spreadsheet  
  - SQL (Structured Query Lang)  
  - can relate data between tables  
Non-relational  
  - data can be stored in a few ways (key-value pairs, wide columns, graphs, documents)
  - flexible, easy to scale
  - excels at storing inconsistent data

[**MongoDB**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/domain-modeling-mongo/blob/master/mongodb.md)
------
open-source NoSQL db  
database has collections, which is made up of documents (objects/binjary JSON or BSON) and documents are made up of fields  
when updating, if you pass an empty object, mongo will update all (pass in multi: true)  
when finding, if you don't pass an argument, mongo will find (and return) all

[**Express**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/express-intro)
------
running `node` in the terminal create an environment similar to working in the console in the browser  
package.json - metadata about the project; what it does, what dependencies it needs  
use `require('pkgName')` to include it in your project

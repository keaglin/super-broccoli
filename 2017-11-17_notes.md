margin's "auto" only works for x-axis (left and right side)  
`background-size: contain` will try to fit your whole image where `background-size: cover` will fill the viewport with as much of the image as will fit and cut off the rest

nothing is defined as "null" by default
everything is default undefined if it's not explicitly assigned a value

`Boolean()` and `!` (bang) are interchangeable for assessing truthiness
`!!` will tell you is a quick way to tell if it's truthy (so basically shorthand for `Boolean()`)

variable can be used interchangeably with "reference"

ctrl + ` = VS Code terminal

++prefix returns the new value  
postFix++ returns the old value  
both increment but it just determines what the incrementor function returns

undefined is reserved for variables whose values haven't been set yet  
null is reserved for variables whose value is explicitly nothing — instead of just "not defined yet."  
null gives us a way to "reset" the value of a variable to "nothing."  

parameters -> variables laid out in function definition  
arguments -> variables passed into function when it's called

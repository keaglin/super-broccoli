[**RSpec**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/rspec)
------

`case...when` is Ruby's `switch...case`

`it` statements are the smallest test and are childless; nothing can be nested inside an `it` statement  
`describe` can contain `it` and other `describe` statements
`context` is a container, like `describe`; rspec will treat them the same and you can nest them inside of each other. Alternate between `describe` and `context` for readability  

unit tests must have both expectations and matchers; expectations tell the test what it should be getting and matchers test if it actually got the expected value from your code  
[Built-in Matchers](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers): make sure you're looking at the docs that match your rspec version!  
`before(:each)` vs `before(:all)`: "each" runs before each test, "all" runs once; really only affects processing speed for the tester

Hiring! (Outcomes)  
don't give up/sticktoitiveness  
solve prob tech-agnostic  
but also be able to pick the right tool for the job  
be able to answer 'why this company specifically' and why you'd be a great fit  
passion => in person enthusiasm; in application intent and storytelling, google alert for the company to use as ice breaker with your point of contact for the company (aka be proactive. eg. reach out if you haven't heard anything)  
soft skills: good comm (talk through thought process on problems), 

Applying to more senior posiitons:  
apply, engage, focus on your strengths and don't apologize for what you may be missing; highlight your contributions  
write cover later  
tailor resume to best fit for the job you're applying to

seniority usually falls into 2 categories, generally:  
years of experience vs familiarity  
sometimes it's contractual, sometimes it narrows the applicant pool  

know the labor pool, what tech/stacks are hot, what's the demand for employees with experience in [x] vs applicants with experience in [x]  

Resume do's and don'ts 
easily see what you do/your role, organized, easy to understand, links to deployed/live projects, don't make em work for it, make it pretty, write something thoughtful (research), demonstrate in cover letter why you wanna work there, what problems can you solve, what can you contribute, know about the company (thoughtful, legitimate, true), short resume (key words, titles, skils), references are HUGE (from someone currently working there)  

share in cover letter experience and passion

show em your persistence (grit)

peopleware (book)

questions to ask at the end of a technical interview: how do you do [x]?, specific and/or in response to something on the website  
can explain gap on LinkedIn or in cover letter or maybe even in resume  
how to demonstrate aptitude/ability to pick up a new lang?  
ask yourself why you wanna learn a thing  
develop a narrative (kinda like what Kat already said)  
talk about where you're going and why; don't talk about why you left (regarding pivot), maybe discuss soft skills

- what was that book called?  
- project [b]euler?  
- hackerrank (already signed up)  
- a16z.com  
- the hard thing about hard things?  

advice:  
- be persistent, define yourself, have a goal (write roadmap or plan and adjust as you learn the industry and yourself)  
- be thoughtful (again) in application processes
- negotiate
- be honest with self

------

`case...when` is Ruby's `switch...case`

`it` statements are the smallest test and are childless; nothing can be nested inside an `it` statement  
`describe` can contain `it` and other `describe` statements
`context` is a container, like `describe`; rspec will treat them the same and you can nest them inside of each other. Alternate between `describe` and `context` for readability  

unit tests must have both expectations and matchers; expectations tell the test what it should be getting and matchers test if it actually got the expected value from your code  
[Built-in Matchers](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers): make sure you're looking at the docs that match your rspec version!  
`before(:each)` vs `before(:all)`: "each" runs before each test, "all" runs once; really only affects processing speed for the tester

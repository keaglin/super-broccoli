[**Testing Node**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/mocha-chai-supertest/)
------
Unit - granular testing a few lines
Application - "Application testing" tends to be a type of Integrated testing
Acceptance - is it up to spec?

TDD vs BDD
BDD (black box testing) is basically like it says: does it behave the way we expect?
TDD is more granular

Mocha - test running framework  
Chai - expectation assertion library  
Supertest - HTTP testing module; used to make HTTP requests inside tests  
`JSON.parse()` will turn a string into an object  
'metadata' is essentially data _about_ your data
'thunks' are higher-order functions that return functions (I think)

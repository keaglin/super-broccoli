functional expression  
return ends the code execution and produces output  
HTML elements (p, body, div) are "nodes" in JS (DOM nodes)  
(the DOM converts HTML elements to JS nodes which we can then call methods on)
DOM allows:  
  -finding elements  
  -get/set content  
  -add fx/animation  
  -create event listeners (which allow user interaction without requiring a hard refresh)  

document is a child of Window ("global object")  
DOM tree consists of DOM nodes and their position in the hierarchy  

[BUMP THIS; WE ON TO ESLINT NOW]  
~~in the root of your project, run "standard --fix" to standardize your code
will work in many cases but not all of course~~

querySelector & getElementById each return one node  
querySelector can use any selector you could use in CSS (eg .class, #id, ul li, p tag, etc)  
querySelectorAll returns an array of nodes that match any given selector  
getElementByClass returns a nodelist of nodes with that class name  
getElementsByTagName allows you to select any html tag, will return a nodelist of nodes with that tag  

NOTE: nodelists are not actually arrays. While they have indexes to access items but Array methods will not/do not work on them

traversing the dom: using the relationships between nodes to select the one you want

3 way to manipulate DOM  
- .className can be used to add/edit classes on a node
- innerHTML can be used to add additional HTML content to a node
- textContent can be used to edit/update the text for a node

blur event is good for form validation

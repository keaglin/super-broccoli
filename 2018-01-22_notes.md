------
stateless and/or presentational  components should be functional (you can use an arrow function; see flashcards -> Definition vs FlashcardContainer)  
separate stateless/presentational and stateful/controller behavior into different components  
keep in mind: make components as small and reusable as possible  
might have to take a second look at Standard JS and just configure it how you want but Idk  
we use PropTypes for type checking, makes code more stable and robust  
using `static` allows declaration of class-level properties; props declared without it are instance-specific and each instance has its own  
we use `prevState` to make sure we're editing the right instance because the `setState()` method is asynchronous  
`setState()` can accept a callback as a second argument which you could use to make sure a given function is performed _after_ `setState()` has run

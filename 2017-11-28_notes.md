**GIT I: Intro to Git**[https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/git-intro]
save small changes and commit them
Terms
-commit: snapshot of changes
-index: staging area; where you specify which files will be committed
-HEAD: currently 'checked out' commit; by default, the most recent but if you co another commit, HEAD would then be that 1
-status: what files have changed and whether or not they're staged

echo "[some stuff]" > [file.ext] will allow you to add the stuff in quotes to that file
echo WILL OVERWRITE anything that *was* in that file
(is it possible to make it such that echo won't overwrite?)

pull retrieves changes AND merges them in
fetch retrieves without merging

**GIT II: Git Branching**[https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/git-branching]
branches branch off from the branch you're on (creating 'some-branch' from 'another-branch' will branch off of 'another-branch' rather than master)
when you `git merge` and come to a conflict
"current change" -> HEAD
"incoming change" -> recent change
when you have a merge conflict, `git merge` will fail and you have to commit your changes before attempting to merge again

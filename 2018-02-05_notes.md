------
.shuffle is not a mutator method but it can be if called with a bang (.shuffle!)

[**Ruby Iterations and Enumerables**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/ruby-iteration-and-enumerables)
------
`next` goes to the next iteration, `break` breaks out of the loop entirely

Enumerables are loops used specifically to do something to or with each item in an iterable/data collection (array, hashes).  
Enumerables are great at traversing, searching, filtering, and modifying collections of data in Ruby.  

`while` is a loop, whereas `.each` is an enumerable
 
eg.  
```ruby
users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
users.each do |user|
  puts user
end
```

shorter version  
```ruby
users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
users.each{ |user| puts user }
```

`.map` creates/returns a new/modified array, `.each` just iterates over the current one

`._method!` (method ending with a bang [!]) indicate that they are 'dangerous' and will mutate the item that they were called on

------
MVC - Model View Controller  
1. model: define our data and its structure  
2. view: define presentation for our data  
3. controller: communicates between model and view; "business logic"

browser sends a request, router tells the controller, controller gets data from model, controller sends it to the view and the view renders a thing in the browser    
`module.exports` is used to allow you to import functionality to different parts of your project  

promises and callbacks - used to make sure one thing is done before starting to do another  

in express, create a controllers folder and add your specific controllers in there (see whenpresident)  
to tell your app, use `app.use()`

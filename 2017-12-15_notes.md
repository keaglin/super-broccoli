Servers - main job is to respond to client requests

[HTTP Request Verb Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods)  
HTTP requests have a location and a verb (request type)
  - ex. going to `google.com`, the location is google.com/ (root) and the verb is `GET`

[Response and Request Header and Bodies](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/node-npm-http-intro#request--response-headers--bodies-5-min-045)  

HTTP is a stateless protocol  
websockets vs http is kinda like walkie talkie vs telephone  

Node is an application runtime environment  
Application Runtime Environment - an environment that supports the running of software (in the case of Node, JS)


MIME types - what a file type looks like to a browser; base-level security measure

REST is a paradigm that matches specific HTTP verbs with different URIs (uniform resource identifiers; like a superset of URLs)

[**Ajax and APIs**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/js-ajax#ajax-and-apis)

### Objectives
- Explain API
- Ajax
- CRUD with APIs
- DOM with APIs

AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML
async means no page refresh

fetch() - several libraries make API calls easier (like jQuery)
JSON - JavaScript Object Notation; it's like a JS object but both key and value are enclosed in double quotes

HTTP only understands strings and serialization is the process of stringifying data structures in order to send them over the internet

an API is an application that provides instructions for how programmers can interact with it via either XML or JSON

AJAX requests take an object with at least 3 key-values pairs:
```js
url: 'location', (where we are getting data from)
type: 'verb', (HTTP request action)
dataType: 'json' 
```

Promises: things that may or may not happen when you connect to the API

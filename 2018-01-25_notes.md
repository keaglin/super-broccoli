[**React and Redux**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-redux)
------

### [Redux Part 1](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-redux/blob/master/redux.md)  
redux centralizes state; can be accessed from any file in the project  
state is read-only (similar to React)  
pure function: no side-effects and only acts in its own scope  
`Object.assign()` creates a 'deep copy' of an object  
reminder: anything written with `switch { case }` can be written with `if`

VSC shortcuts: 
- shift-cmd-[up/down] to copy the line you're on above or below itself
- cmd-d to select instances of the word your cursor is currently occupying

named export requires named import whereas anonymously exported components can be imported and given any name

named export
```js
const Component = (props) => {}
export default Component
```

anonymous export
```js
export default (props) => {}
```

### [Redux Part 2](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-redux/blob/master/react-redux.md)  
3 main components of redux: store, actions, reducers  
payload is data sent to the reducer

### Hit List/Questions
- higher order functions (array methods especially) and common implementations
- spread operator
- if the data is immutable, how are we updating state at all?
- where is ID coming from?
